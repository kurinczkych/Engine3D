# 3D Engine
Welcome to my 3D Game Engine, a powerful and versatile tool designed for creating immersive and visually stunning 3D games. This engine is currently a work in progress, with ongoing development aimed at enhancing its features, performance, and overall usability. Despite being in an early stage, it already offers a range of robust capabilities that can help bring your creative visions to life.

## Overview

Key Features (In progress)

+ Advanced GPU Shaders: Leverage complex GPU shaders to achieve cutting-edge visual effects and realism in your games.

+ Comprehensive Game Editor: A robust game editor, still under active development, allows you to design, organize, and manage all aspects of your game world.

+ PhysX Physics Engine: Experience realistic object interactions with the integrated PhysX physics engine, allowing dynamic objects to fall, collide, and interact naturally with each other and static models.

+ Lighting Engine: Create dynamic and realistic lighting scenarios with our sophisticated lighting engine, which is being refined to enhance the atmosphere and depth of your game environments.

+ Texture and Roughness Engine: Fine-tune surface details with an advanced texture and roughness engine, delivering high-fidelity materials and surfaces.

+ Location-Aware Sound System: Implement immersive audio experiences with a location-aware sound system that adjusts audio volume based on proximity to sound emitters.

+ Particle System: Bring your game scenes to life with an integrated particle system, allowing for complex and visually engaging effects like fire, smoke, and explosions.

## Current State

The project's branches kind of are all over the place, this program is very much is in progress.
Im currently working on making the in-game editor nicer and adding functionalities. 

I believe the current last commit is not even runnable, but i soon fix that.
Apart from that, in this version:
+ You can drag and drop 3D models into the scene, using the bottom file manager
+ You can assign a texture to the given model, with rough map, normal map, etc
+ You can add colliders to the models, and if its dynamic, it will fall and collide with other objects

Features you can only access by changing the code currently:
+ Audio system
+ Particle system
+ Light sources
+ Camera manipulation
+ Save states
+ Editing any world or player, camera settings.
